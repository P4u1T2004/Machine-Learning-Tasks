by 2008 you were the biggest airline in the country having a 27% market share yes right what went wrong if things were right your marketing was working you had everything right in fact before even you answer that I want to go to which is often talked about is your training of cabin crew what was the idea behind that you selected certain people based on how they look or how they're going to be presented yeah well you know I mean at the end of the day you have you have very good-looking ladies who sadly can't speak very well now what is one of the key attributes of a cabin crew communication i mean you may look good but if you can't communicate with the passenger that doesn't serve the purpose the kind of service standards that I set for the airline and my service standards were unique they included in business class the aeroses cleaning the reading glasses and spectacles of our customers we call them guests right so there were little things that made a vast difference in the customer experience tell me two more thing two two three more things this is one okay secondly the food was second to none right the quality of the seats themselves the recline and all the rest of it what they call the seat pitch it's second to none so there was so many little attributes we called customers not passengers but guests many airlines have copied us since but they were the little little things that made a difference i was very focused on the service delivery excellence of King Krishna you can go further because you don't know this you can't ask me the question so let me tell you yeah in the first one year the airport manager at every single airport in India had to send me on my personal mobile and SMS the flight number the scheduled time of departure and the actual departure time so every night before I went to bed which was rather late I used to look at my phone every single flight of king fisher of that day I used to monitor personally the on-time performance you were so detailed focused you were so because the the service industry in the airline industry requires focus requires detailed focus so agreed then it worked in your favor till 2008 what happened then simple you've ever heard of Lemon Brothers yeah you ever heard of the global financial crisis right did it not impact India of course it did the whole aviation sector was forget aviation every sector every sector was Yeah stopped it got dry the value of the Indian rupee so I went to Shri Pranab Mukhuji then finance minister of India having grown up in Kolkata i speak fairly decent Bengali m and I said down which means I have to downsize this aine I have to cut the number of aircraft I have to lay off employees right because I can't afford to operate under these depressed economic circumstances He said no at this time connectivity is important the jobs and employment are important particularly because you know typically in an airline they're not blue collar workers huh they're not like work men and the the boys and girls who work in an airline can't be classified as blue collar and he said I don't want them to lose their jobs so you continue banks will support you that is how it all started I was told not to downsize king fisher at that time and yes the banks did support all right now what happened then lot is well you tell me the narrative I'll tell you the truth truth you tell me the narrative then there was a consortium formed of 17 banks and the loan was given to you via SBI right was that the first or IDBI was first see this is where people are not aware m I acquired a which everybody says was a big mistake right in $1 137 million or something like that everybody says you overpaid for it in the world of business there's something known as consolidation industry consolidation there is something known as eliminate the disruptor okay eden was famous for advertising and promoting one rupee tickets yeah clearly you could never ever sustain any airline business selling tickets for one rupee right okay it was a bait h but that set certain price expectations in the mindset of the customers yeah and affected not only Decker which was losing money but the industry as a whole of which King Fisher was also a part right so at that time we looked at it was also Bangalore based it had the same Abus aircraft it had the same train pilots as King Fisher so there was a lot of engineering compatibility plus scale and size with a merger of Kingfisher and Deca eliminate the disruptor and consolidate the industry and Kingfisher Airlines that was the logic of buying Dean not this much touted logic of I was desperate to fly overseas i needed to get past that 5-year hurdle complete nonsense now why should I shout from the rooftops trying to trying to clarify this but if you talk to anybody about elimination of a disruptor and consolidation of industry it'll start make and commonality of equipment it'll start making business sense but if your philosophy was to make a premium airline why would you buy something which stands for lowc cost carrier which stands for something cheap which stands for one rupee ticket because the customers would be completely different the only obvious sense which anybody could make it out from it was if you are going for a different vision you are probably going out because the 5year window which you wanted uh which you wanted to bounce right probably yeah of course like that was the logic like I to clarify to tell people who don't know about it the logic that people talk about is if an Indian airline wanted to fly overseas they should have operated in India for at least 5 years before getting the license to operate air and you didn't have that and that's why you bought air deckin so that you could start flying overseas and you paid an absurd amount of price for it that's what people say so who are the people that you're quoting everybody like all the things that I've read all the all the media like media right yeah like the legacy media right the legacy media the people who are responsible for giving us the information I mean that's what as a citizen that's where I get my information from correct and at least from the ones who I really respect so I don't think anybody at UB group was that dumb with a lack of business understanding to buy an airline an operating airline just to be able to fly overseas m I'm telling you the logic was consolidation of the industry given the commonality of equipment i referred a little earlier to the installation of a front cabin or business class which we called king first which Indigo are doing even now there are certain roots in India that demand M right a front cabin where there are people who will only fly business class fair but the bulk of India people want a singleass product dean fitted that bill fantastically right we opened up more routes than had ever been opened before or available for air connectivity that was one of the biggest contributions we made to the Indian aviation sector and economy right dean also played a part in that so Kingfisher's sad failure subsequently had nothing to do with Dean okay nothing to do with how much we paid for Dean right got it those were totally separate set of reasons right but business reasons here's a question on it so I get the idea that you wanted to service more routes you wanted to consolidate that was a business decision you saw that hey I want to build a premium airline but there's a bulk of India who cares about the price and you wanted to contribute to make sure that I want to make sure that India gets to fly anywhere and everywhere through the price point which air deckin provides and if I could be the one to consolidate it and I could be the one to actually eliminate the disruptor I should do it business decision brilliant do you think then the wrong decision was to rebranded to Kingfisher Red because you can't start operating one Deckan and one King Fisher so we just called it King Fisher Red i mean rebranding is is is common in the world take Coca-Cola right there's Coke there's Coke Zero there's Diet Coke it's all coke right so a multibrand strategy is no rocket science yeah but then the philosophy of air decken was low cost and then king fisher red so kingfisher stood for premium kingfisher red stood for low cost it was differentiated king fisher first and king fisher red okay right you tell me something what's the difference between coke zero and dad coke tell me just two names I don't know yeah fine what's the philosophy behind it you don't know so how can all these commentators be commenting on King Fisher first and King Fer Red you know this the trouble in India is that there are too many commentators who don't understand the facts and of course the media plays to the gallery and that's how disinformation gets spread wide and then you stated somewhere again the commentators I'm quoting that I want to if I've put in a name king fisher on an airline no matter even if it's low cost i want to provide all the services you started providing all the services you started providing catering you started providing everything in a lowcost carrier didn't you i began by saying that King Fisher started off with all the attributes of Locos carrier which is single class standard fleet etc etc etc but I said the only differentiator was inflat entertainment and food [Music] I mean just because I gave food didn't make it a full service carrier I mean you want I shall I give you examples you go on any lowc cost carrier here in Europe all right do they starve you or do they feed you but you have to pay for it no all of them i don't know a few of them the ones are flown okay so there are exceptions okay but that what the business like that's what everybody talks about right you know that's the problem lack of information and knowledge and more importantly no domain knowledge of the aviation industry leads to all sorts of speculation that makes no sense so you tell us that does it make business sense to provide food and inflight entertainment in a lowcost carrier where people don't care about it wait our belief was Indians love food and love entertainment that was for King Fisher first but not for Kingfisher Red kingfisher Red stands for low price why an inflight entertainment system doesn't cost you money to operate every day but still cost you a lot of money which eventually will bleed your balance sheet really i'm asking you not in our opinion do you think that was the wrong decision what just providing Yeah after acquiring Deckin giving all the services of a full full service carrier in a lowcost carrier the flow the the full service carrier part of it was very distinct from the so-called lowcost carrier uh at the end of the day however you may refer to these business models uh it's all about the price your customers are willing to pay and whether you can fill your plans simple so all models are academic and theoretical that really are irrelevant but your critiques say that you were competing against other lowc cost carriers like like at that time was it I think Indigo started at that time and Spice started at that time I think Spice Spice was there on and off yeah but more often so you were competing with lowc cost carriers with their pricing but you were providing something extra and that's why your business model was bleeding more money than them and you expected that this will turn into loyal customers but the moment you increase price people would not fly your cl your flights was it that's true that's what the critics say they are all aviation experts i have nothing to say so where was the problem then if this was not the problem then what happened the problem was the government the problem was fairly and squarely the government and I you know they made a lot of political hay out of this when I used to write to Prime Minister Manm Singh uh when I used to write uh to to to the civil aviation ministers ministers of finance the cost of crude international crude went to $140 a barrel the price of aviation turbine fuel in India was directly related to the cost of international crude oil so you can see that from an average of about $60 a barrel crude oil went to $140 a barrel with the resultant and equivalent increase in the price of aviation turbine fuel m the state governments levied and ad valorum sales tax on aviation turbine fuel so you can yourself now begin to imagine the financial impact on the airline operating where fuel costs are the single largest component of cost so I pleaded I said look please give aviation turbine fuel declared good status so that it attracts central sales tax and not this punitive ad valorum state sales tax right because the states are making windfall profits anyway that the government did not do okay aviation is regarded as a capital intensive industry right it's acknowledged as such worldwide right they would not permit foreign investment it was sad that only 6 months after King Airlines shut right that they permitted AIA to invest in jet i had already reached agreement with the CEO of Edihad in Geneva for them to invest in King Fisher which government did not permiss so we could not capitalize the airline through a foreign investor either why didn't they allow they should ask government right so my point is the economy the circumstances the government policy then existing all conspired to create a perfect storm through which King Fisher could not survive i mean that's the sad part of it if you talk about kingfisher the concept and UB group's diversification into aviation I'll answer it in one sentence the two biggest orders for aircraft in the world today are Air India and Indigo both Indian carriers the fastest growing aviation market in the world today is India now if you yourself acknowledge that in 2008 Kingfisher was the largest airline with a 27% market share had events not conspired against us right you can imagine where king could potentially have been today but sadly not all businesses work out sometimes you win sometimes you lose thank you so much
